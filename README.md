#My-First is ALSO a  test file for github
 
 
A test file that will show me that I have a full understanding of the git concept and that I can do this myself.

Althoug I'm posting this publically for all to see its really more for me.
Consider this my "HELLO WORLD" to the programming world. 

Its (programming) is a LOTTA work BUT, I know and can feel DEEP down in my
 bones that it's worth it... 

Anywho. GREAT JOB KRYSTLE!!! I'M PROUD OF YOU!!
